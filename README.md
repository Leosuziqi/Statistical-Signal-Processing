# Statistical-Signal-Processing
It includes my homeworks and contributed project programed in MatLab Simulation tool for UBC Master course EECE562 - Statistical Signal Processing. 

I learned useful tools in the estimation and optimization of stochastic dynamical systems in the field of in signal processing, control and telecommunications. In particular, focused on discrete-time Markov decision processes, and will study stochastic state space models and stochastic simulation; Bayesian state estimation; ML parameter estimation; and stochastic control.
